# RollCalc
Java program to calculate dice rolls for a target average or max value. I made this for D&D reasons.
### Usage
#### java RollCalc [avg/max] [num]
Arg 1 ([avg/max]) should be either "avg" if you want to calculate the dice to result in a target average, or "max" if you want to calculate the dice to result in a target maximum.

Arg 2 ([num]) is your target value for either an average or maximum result of the rolls!
